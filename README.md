# The Stenophone

As you can see this hasn't been worked on in a while. Nevertheless I still think about it and perhaps someone found it interesting to read so it's still here.

A musical instrument combining [live coding](http://toplap.org) and [stenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype).

Developed in the [Augmented Instruments Laboratory](http://instrumentslab.org) by [Jack Armitage](http://jackarmitage.com).

Presented at the [International Conference on Live Coding 2017](http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2017/), Morelia, Mexico. ([Article PDF](https://github.com/jarmitage/stenophone/raw/master/docs/stenophone_iclc2017.pdf))

## Abstract

Though laptop live coders are known to use other devices and instruments and play with other musicians, laptop live coding generally shares the common physical interface of the QWERTY keyboard. This project seeks to provide a means to explore alternatives to the QWERTY keyboard as a physical interface to laptop live coding. We present a live coding keyboard which is also a digital musical instrument, called the Stenophone. The Stenophone is an augmented stenotype or chorded keyboard, which permits continuous gestural control of keys and features an ergonomic design. These capabilities are exploited to enable the manipulation of algorithms and their parameterisation simultaneously.
